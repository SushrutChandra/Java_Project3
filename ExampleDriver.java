 *  THIS CLASS IS PROVDED FOR YOU.  USE IT TO TEST THE FlagMaker
 *  CLASS THAT YOU ARE WRITING.
 *   
 *  This driver relies on the "drawFlag" method of the "FlagMaker"
 *  class.  It prompts the user to enter information about what flag
 *  he/she would like to see and in what size it should be created.  
 *  Then it creates a MyGrid object, and calls
 *  the drawFlag method of the FlagMaker class to actually draw
 *  the Flag in the grid this driver creates.
